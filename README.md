# Fanning

A desktop application for automatically controlling computer fan speeds based on values of temperature sensors. It features a GUI for defining mappings from temperatures to fan speeds.

NOTE: This is not a complete, working software. It is able to control fan speeds if a suitable backend is provided, but none exist currently. There was an effort to create [OpenHardwareMonitorWrapper](https://github.com/Tuupertunut/OpenHardwareMonitorWrapper) but I can't remember if it ever reached a functional state.
